## what is rizzly?

rizzly is an ai-powered desktop app that helps you navigate dating apps with confidence. if you've ever stared at someone's profile wondering what to say, or drafted a message that just didn't feel right, rizzly is designed to help. 

think of it as your personal dating wingman - an ai assistant that analyzes profiles, crafts personalized messages, and provides real-time feedback to help you make better connections. it runs locally on your computer and integrates directly with dating apps through an embedded browser.

## meet bufo, your dating companion

bufo is rizzly's mascot and emotional intelligence system. he reacts to conversations with over 100 different expressions and emotions, providing visual feedback on how your interactions are going. when you're doing well, he gets excited. when something needs work, his expressions let you know.

beyond being charming, bufo adapts to your communication style and dating goals, making the entire experience more engaging and less stressful than traditional dating app interfaces.

## how rizzly works

when you first launch rizzly, it learns about your dating preferences through a personalized onboarding flow. it discovers your goals (serious relationships, casual dating, or exploration), understands your communication style (witty, flirty, intellectual, direct), and learns about your interests and conversation topics.

once set up, you navigate to your preferred dating app within rizzly's browser and start chatting with bufo. ask him to "analyze her photos" for profile insights, request "write me an opener" for personalized first messages, or say "how should i rephrase this?" for message improvement suggestions.

rizzly also includes an emergency intervention system that helps prevent potentially problematic messages from being sent, acting as a safety net for your dating conversations.

## technical implementation

rizzly is built with react and typescript, packaged as an electron desktop application. the ai functionality is powered by sambanova's llama 3.3 70b model, providing sophisticated natural language processing for dating-specific scenarios.

the interface uses tailwindcss for styling, with webpack and electron-forge handling the build process. the app includes developer tools for advanced users, including automatic photo downloading, browser integration controls, and debugging capabilities.

## getting started

first, obtain a free api key from sambanova.ai. then clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rizzly.git
cd rizzly
npm install 
npm start
```

complete the onboarding process to set your preferences, add your api key in the settings, and begin receiving personalized dating assistance from bufo.

## why rizzly exists

dating apps can be challenging to navigate effectively. crafting engaging messages, interpreting profiles, and maintaining interesting conversations requires skills that don't come naturally to everyone. rizzly bridges this gap by providing ai-powered assistance that adapts to your personality and dating goals.

the goal is to make dating apps less intimidating and more successful, while maintaining authenticity in your interactions.
