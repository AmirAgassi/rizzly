**rizzly is an ai-powered desktop app that helps you navigate dating apps with confidence.** if you've ever stared at someone's profile wondering what to say, or drafted a message that just didn't feel right, this is for you.

think of it as your personal dating wingman that analyzes profiles, crafts messages, and provides real-time feedback. it runs locally and integrates directly with dating apps through an embedded browser.

### **how it works**

rizzly learns your dating preferences through onboarding - your goals, communication style, and interests. then you just chat with bufo about profiles and messages.

> *"analyze her photos"* -> get profile insights  
> *"write me an opener"* -> personalized first messages  
> *"how should i rephrase this?"* -> message improvements  

**emergency intervention** prevents you from sending potentially problematic messages, acting as a safety net for your conversations.

from your swipes, to your dms, rizzly is here to help.

### **get started**

```bash
# grab a free api key from sambanova.ai first
git clone https://github.com/AmirAgassi/rizzly.git
cd rizzly && npm install && npm start
```

complete onboarding, add your api key, and start getting personalized dating assistance.

### **why rizzly exists**

dating apps can be challenging. crafting engaging messages and interpreting profiles requires skills that don't come naturally to everyone. rizzly bridges this gap with ai assistance that adapts to your personality, making dating apps less intimidating and more successful.
